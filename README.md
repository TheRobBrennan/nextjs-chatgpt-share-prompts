# Welcome

This project explores the creation of a [Next.js v13](https://nextjs.org) full-stack application based on the YouTube video available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wm5gMKuwSYk).

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes you have Node.js and NPM already installed on your system.

To verify:

```sh
# Let's see what version of Node.js is on my development system
% node -v
v18.16.0

# Let's see what version of npm is on my development system
% npm -v
9.5.1
```

### Use create-next-app

Starting from an empty directory, we'll use [create-next-app](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app) to create a brand new [Next.js v13](https://nextjs.org) full-stack application:

```sh
# Create a new Next.js app in the current directory
% npx create-next-app@latest ./
```
